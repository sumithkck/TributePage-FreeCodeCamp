            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Dennis Ritchie was born September 9, 1941 in Bronxville,New York.His father was long time Bell Lab scientist and the co-author of the "Design of Switching Circuits".
            </p>
            <p>
                He moved to Summit,New Jersey wiht his family and got his High School degree from Summit High School.After that he graduated form Harvard University with dgrees in Physics and Applied Mathematics.
            </p>
            <p>
                In year 1967 he began working in Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center and while being ther he defended his PhD thesis on "Computational Complexity and Program Structure" at Havard and his supervisor was Patrick C.Fischer.However he never got a
                PhD degree officially since he did not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard library.

            <h2>Career and Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970,
                Brian Kernighan suggested the name "Unix", a pun on the name "Multics".To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute
                to the development of Unix and C for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000â€“2500 letters.Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security
                Agency, the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle was applicable to machines still in use by foreign governments.
            </P>
            <p>
                Ritchie was also involved with the development of the Plan 9 and Inferno operating systems, and the programming language Limbo.

            </p>
            <p>
                As part of an AT&T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ritchie is best known as the creator of the C programming language, a key developer of the Unix operating system, and co-author of the book The C Programming Language; he was the 'R' in K&R (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan and Ritchie).
                Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.They were so influential on
                Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, "The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed.
            </p>
            <p>Ritchie passed away on October 12,2011 at the age 70 in Berkeley Heights,New Jersey </p>
